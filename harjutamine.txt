Github on platform, mis annab võimaluse rohkem kui kahel inimestel töötada ühe failiga samal ajal ja vahetada koode. 
Githubi võib kasutada igal kohal kus on arvuti ja interneti võrk  olemas.
Nüüdest hakkan kasutama Githubi selleks, et harjutama õppeülesandidega ja hakkan salvestama siin oma koodid.
GitHub, Inc. is an American multinational corporation that provides hosting for software development and version control using Git. It offers the distributed version control and source code management (SCM) functionality of Git, plus its own features. It provides access control and several collaboration features such as bug tracking, feature requests, task management, continuous integration and wikis for every project.[4] Headquartered in California, it has been a subsidiary of Microsoft since 2018.[5]

GitHub offers its basic services free of charge. Its more advanced professional and enterprise services are commercial.[6] Free GitHub accounts are commonly used to host open-source projects.[7] As of January 2019, GitHub offers unlimited private repositories to all plans, including free accounts, but allowed only up to three collaborators per repository for free.[8] Starting from April 15, 2020, the free plan allows unlimited collaborators, but restricts private repositories to 2,000 minutes of GitHub Actions[9] per month.[10] As of January 2020, GitHub reports having over 40 million users[11] and more than 190 million repositories[12] (including at least 28 million public repositories),[13] making it the largest host of source code in the world.
